Project Introduction

This project was undertaken as part of the Programming and Scripting assessment module, which is a core module in the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics at the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology. 

Project Objectives

Research the data set and write a summary about it.

1.0 Intro to Fisherâ€™s Iris Data Set

1.1 Acquiring the data

[Add some basic infor about kaggle here]
Dataset obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/arshid/iris-flower-dataset

1.3 Getting a feel for the data:

The df.info() function returns some basic information about the dataset.[1] Firstly, it returns the first and last 5 lines of the dataset and further, using the pandas df.info() function, it tells us the type of data we are dealing with that is, a DataFrame, which is a 2-dimensional array with 150 columns and 5 rows. It tells us that there are 5 columns (or attributes): 4 of which are quantitative, sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width, while one, species, is categorical. Further, it returns the data type of each attribute. The quantitative are all of type float64 and the categorical is of object type. This will determine what type of analysis we can perform on the data. Next, it returns the memory usage of the dataset, which is 6.0KB. Finally, we can see that there are no non-null values in our dataset which ensures data integrity and prevents potentially inaccurate conclusions.

The pd.set_option() function allows us to view the entire dataset (i.e., 150 rows and 5 columns). It takes in two parameters: pat (a specified option) and value (in our case, the amount of rows we wish to display).[2]

```def dataInfo(x):
    print(x)
    x = df.info()
    print(x) 
```
